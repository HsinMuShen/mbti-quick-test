      "p1": "The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the world's most popular personality frameworks. It was developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, based on the psychological types proposed by Carl Jung in the early 20th century.",
      "p2": "MBTI sorts people into 16 personality types using four pairs of opposite preferences: Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I), Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N), Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P). Each type reflects how you prefer to focus your energy, take in information, make decisions, and organize your life.",
      "p3": "Understanding your type can help you recognize your strengths, communication style, and how you work with others. Many people use it for self-awareness, career exploration, and improving relationships.",
      "p4": "This site offers a free, quick MBTI-style test that takes about 1–2 minutes. It uses a decision-tree approach: a short series of questions that narrow down to the type that best fits your answers. For in-depth guides on the four dimensions and how to use your result, visit our Articles section."

    "fourDimensions": "The Four Dimensions",
    "dimensionsContent": "MBTI uses four pairs of opposite preferences. Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I) describes where you get energy—from the outer world or your inner world. Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N) describes how you take in information—through concrete details or patterns and possibilities. Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F) describes how you make decisions—by logic or by values and impact on people. Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P) describes how you organize your life—with structure and closure or with flexibility and openness.",

    "useCasesContent": "People use MBTI for self-awareness, career exploration, improving communication in relationships and teams, and understanding differences in learning and work styles. It is not a measure of skill or intelligence—it describes preferences, not abilities. No type is better or worse; each has strengths and growth areas."

It categorizes people into 16 personality types using four dimensions: Introversion/Extraversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. Each dimension describes a preference (e.g. where you get energy, how you take in information), and the four letters together form your type. Our site offers a short, free test that uses a decision tree to suggest the type that best fits your answers, plus articles and descriptions to help you learn more.",
      "howAccurateAnswer": "This is a quick test designed for entertainment and self-discovery. It uses a decision tree: your answers to a series of questions narrow down to one of the 16 types. While that method can give consistent and meaningful results, it is not a replacement for the full, official MBTI assessment or professional psychological evaluation. Results may vary with context and over time. We recommend using your result as a starting point for self-reflection and as a way to explore the 16 types—not as a final label.",

      "professionalUseAnswer": "This test is designed for entertainment and personal insight only. It is not validated for hiring, clinical diagnosis, or formal assessment. If you need results for career counseling, team building, or mental health purposes, please use the official MBTI instrument administered by a certified practitioner or seek a licensed psychologist. Our content and test are meant to help you learn about personality types in a fun, low-pressure way."
